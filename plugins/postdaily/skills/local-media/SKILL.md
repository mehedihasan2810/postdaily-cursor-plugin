# Attaching a file from the user's device to a PostDaily post

Files reachable by a public `https://` URL are simplest — pass that URL to
`import_media`. For a file on the user's device there are two ways in; use the
first one you can.

## If you can run commands and read the file

This works in a coding agent on the user's computer.

1. Check the file exists and read its size and type:

   ```bash
   wc -c < "path/to/file"
   file --mime-type -b "path/to/file"
   ```

   Accepted types: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, `video/mp4`,
   `video/quicktime`, `video/webm` and `application/pdf`. Convert anything else
   first (for example a GIF or HEIC to PNG or MP4) and tell the user you did.

2. Call `create_media_upload` with the `workspaceId`, `filename`,
   `contentType` and `sizeBytes`. It returns `uploadUrl`, `headers` and a
   `mediaId`. The URL works once and expires at `expiresAt`.

3. Upload the file's bytes with an HTTP PUT to `uploadUrl`, sending every
   entry in `headers` exactly as given: the URL is signed for that content
   type and size. Write the command yourself, with the file's real path,
   quoted, and one `-H` for each header:

   ```bash
   curl --fail -X PUT --upload-file "path/to/file" \
     -H "Content-Type: image/png" \
     "UPLOAD_URL"
   ```

   Do not print or log the upload URL anywhere else; it grants a write.

4. Call `complete_media_upload` with the `mediaId`. PostDaily checks the
   stored file has the size and type you declared, and returns it with its
   dimensions or duration. A mismatch means the wrong file or a changed file
   was sent — start again from step 1.

## If you cannot

This is the way in a chat on the web, the desktop or a phone, even when the
user attached the file to the conversation: the chat's copy of the file can't
be sent to PostDaily.

1. Call `list_media`. It returns `uploadUrl`, a PostDaily page where the user
   uploads files from their own device into the workspace, and `now`, the
   current time.
2. Give the user that link and ask them to upload the file there and tell you
   when it is done.
3. Call `list_media` again with `uploadedAfter` set to that `now`: it returns
   only what they added. Use its `mediaId`.

## Attach it and check

Attach the file with `media: [{ "mediaId": "…", "altText": "…" }]` on
`create_post`, `update_post` or `validate_post`. Write alt text for images from
what the image actually shows — look at it first if you can.

Run `validate_post` with the media attached: each network has its own limits
on size, length, aspect ratio and how many files a post can carry, and the
check reports them per channel.

# Posting with PostDaily

PostDaily's tools come from the `postdaily` MCP server this plugin adds. If
they are not available yet, the user has not signed in: ask them to open
Cursor Settings → Tools & MCPs and connect postdaily. PostDaily opens in the
browser to choose workspaces and an access level; after that the tools just
work.

## Before writing anything

1. Call `list_workspaces`, then `list_channels`. Never invent ids. A channel
   can also be named by network (`bluesky`) or `@handle`; if a name matches
   more than one channel the tool returns the candidates — ask which one.
2. Pinterest needs a board and TikTok a privacy level the account allows:
   call `get_channel_options` for those channels before setting options.
3. Read `postdaily://guide/networks` when you are unsure what a network takes
   (length limits, media rules, what a first comment does).

## Writing

- Write for each network rather than pasting one text everywhere. Put the
  per-network versions in `channelSettings` (`{ channel, text, options }`);
  `text` is the default for the rest.
- For X, Threads, Bluesky and Mastodon, a long post can be a `thread` of parts
  instead of one text.
- Run `validate_post` on the finished post. It checks every channel's rules
  without saving anything.

## Saving, scheduling and publishing

- **Default to a draft** (`mode: "draft"`). Schedule only when the user asked
  for it: `mode: "queue"` for each channel's next free slot, or
  `mode: "scheduled"` with `scheduledAt`. A time without an offset is read in
  the workspace's timezone — say which timezone you used.
- **Publishing right now** (`mode: "now"`) and `retry_post` need
  `confirmPublish: true`. Before sending it, show the exact text, media and
  channels and get a clear yes. The plugin also asks the user in Cursor
  before the call goes out.
- If a result has `outcome: "needs_confirmation"` because of warnings, show the
  warnings, and only re-send with `confirmWarnings: true` if the user agrees.
- Send an `idempotencyKey` (a fresh UUID) with every write, and reuse the same
  key if you retry the same call, so a retry can never post twice.
- A post to several channels becomes one post per channel; report each one.

## After saving

- Give the user what the tool returned: the post ids, the scheduled times and
  any link into PostDaily, so they can review it there.
- To move a scheduled post, use `schedule_post` with a new time. To take one
  back to drafts, `schedule_post` with `mode: "draft"`. `cancel_post` and
  `delete_post` need the user's go-ahead first.
- For a failed post, call `get_post` for the network's real error before
  suggesting a fix. If a channel needs reconnecting or a plan limit was hit,
  pass on the link from the error — that is fixed in PostDaily, not here.

## Access levels

A connection is Full access, Drafts only or Read only, and only sees the tools
its level allows. If a tool you need is missing, tell the user to reconnect
with a higher level: disconnect postdaily in Cursor Settings → Tools & MCPs,
connect again and choose it on the consent page.
